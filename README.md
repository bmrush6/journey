## Garmin Connect setup

Install the dependency:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Log in once and cache session tokens to `~/.garminconnect`:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com GARMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword python3 garmin_login.py
```

If the variables aren't set, the script prompts for them interactively
(the password prompt is hidden). If two-factor auth is enabled on the
account, you'll be prompted for the MFA code. Subsequent runs reuse the
cached tokens in `~/.garminconnect` and won't need credentials again
until the tokens expire.

Never commit real credentials — use environment variables or a local
`.env` file (already gitignored).
